In discount dining finder I showed how to make a map-based tool to search all Eat Out to Help Out (EOTHO) establishments in very little time.
What follows is the story of what happened after the site launched, and how I failed to make a dent at marketing.
To recap:</description></item><item><title>Discounted Dining Finder</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/discounted_dining_finder/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2020 23:55:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/discounted_dining_finder/</guid><description>This post describes how I developed the Discount Dining Finder a lookup map tool for the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in my spare time. I currently work with Equal Experts and HMRC. The aim of this writing is to provide an insight into how problems of scaling services can be solved by having no servers and not using &amp;ldquo;serverless services&amp;rdquo; either.
Aperitif A really nice side effect in working in a high functioning environment is that sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re involved in bouncing ideas off each other.</description></item><item><title>The Shield and the Sword</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/the_shield_and_the_sword/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 15:40:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/the_shield_and_the_sword/</guid><description>To successfully deliver software a developer needs a shield and a sword.
A good product owner, delivery manager or alike that will shield the engineers from having to attend too many meetings, giving long-winded status updates and essentially allow them to get on with it. Shields go to all the meetings with the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; and explain what can and cannot be done, without the engineer having to attend. A shield would also filter all the last-minute requirements or requests for gold plating without having to be dragged into endless meetings.</description></item><item><title>Making Software. Quickly.</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/making_software_quickly/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 08:54:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/making_software_quickly/</guid><description>In this post, I describe my personal experience of being part of a software development team working with Equal Experts and HMRC during Covid-19. Under normal circumstances, we&amp;rsquo;re responsible for tax services such as Self Assessment, PAYE Expenses and Benefits, VAT submissions amongst others. These services run on the Multi-channel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP). This platform is hosted in a hyperscale cloud (the cloud provider has a sideline selling books), run in-house by HMRC teams made up of permanent staff and consultants.</description></item><item><title>One million records in 15 seconds</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_million_records_in_15s/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 10:29:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/one_million_records_in_15s/</guid><description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about optimisations that I recently used to provide a Scala Microservice that surfaced payment events. The events were held in an Oracle backend and the Microservice was in a docker container with (1 vCPU) allocated 512MB to the container and 256MB to the JVM that was running it. In this writing I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about the Oracle optimisations to make the underlying query fly but rather would like to concentrate on the kinds of things that can make service code quick.</description></item><item><title>Coerced to make Xerces think</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/coerced_to_make_xerces_think/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 23:45:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/coerced_to_make_xerces_think/</guid><description>More and more I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that XML is evil! This is the third part of my series on why, as a software engineer, it is very useful to think about the potentially dangerous combination of outdated libraries and XML.
I recently carried out a review of the dependency scanning results CVE-2012-0881:
Apache Xerces2 Java allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted message to an XML service, which triggers hash table collisions.</description></item><item><title>How I learned to stop worrying and love a vulnerability</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2018 10:22:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_a_vulnerability/</guid><description>Security specialists. Arghhh! They&amp;rsquo;re all sitting in their &amp;lsquo;ivory tower&amp;rsquo; without anything better to do than to take a baseball bat to your hard work and tell you how you&amp;rsquo;ve not considered some obscure vulnerability CVE-142341231/4234 in a library that you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. Not only that, there is definitely no way that you can deploy now, even when the product owner is breathing down your neck saying that nobody is going home until we&amp;rsquo;ve fixed this!</description></item><item><title>Hiding XXE in Spreadsheets</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 12:24:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/hiding_xxe_in_spreadsheets/</guid><description>Recently I tried to poke holes in a service. I found myself laughing out loud. This was a vulnerability whereby modifying a SAML authentication while being rePOSTed via the browser allowed me to inject a malicious payload (see XML External Entity (XXE) Processing and XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet) that could be used to use up a service&amp;rsquo;s memory and CPU. Health checks and automatic service restarts would have healed the service but it still would have allowed an attacker to mount a Denial of Service attack without needing a lot of requests.</description></item><item><title>Laughing out loud - Malicious Reauthentication</title><link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 10:02:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://beny23.github.io/posts/laughing_out_loud_malicious_auth/</guid><description>Background I had found a vulnerability that made it is possible to insert maliciously crafted XML into the SAML payload that a reauthentication application returned to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability came about due to the use of a out-of-date but still widely used library.
The service could have been made to consume a lot of CPU and memory causing it respond very slowly if at all.</description></item></channel></rss>
