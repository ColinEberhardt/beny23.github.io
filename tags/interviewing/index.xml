This post illustrates my thinking.
Why do you ask? To put it in a bit of context, I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer, I&amp;rsquo;m not a recruiter, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with technical interviewing for quite a while, and have marked a fair number of take-home tests over the years, but recently we thought that the experience was not as good as it could be.</description></item></channel></rss>
