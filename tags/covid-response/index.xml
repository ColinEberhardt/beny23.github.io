Under normal circumstances, we&amp;rsquo;re responsible for tax services such as Self Assessment, PAYE Expenses and Benefits, VAT submissions amongst others. These services run on the Multi-channel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP). This platform is hosted in a hyperscale cloud (the cloud provider has a sideline selling books), run in-house by HMRC teams made up of permanent staff and consultants.</description></item></channel></rss>
