This write-up shows how to reproduce it using Ubuntu and what to do to check whether a system is vulnerable.
What went wrong? Quoting from the original researchers:
This vulnerability is an attacker&amp;rsquo;s dream come true:
pkexec is installed by default on all major Linux distributions; pkexec is vulnerable since its creation, in May 2009; any unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain full root privileges; although this vulnerability is technically a memory corruption, it is exploitable instantly, reliably, in an architecture-independent way; and it is exploitable even if the polkit daemon itself is not running.</description></item></channel></rss>
